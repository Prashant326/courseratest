        <p class="content">
          Pav bhaji is a spiced mixture of mashed vegetables in a thick gravy
          served with bread. Vegetables in the curry may commonly include
          potatoes, onions, carrots, chillies, peas, bell peppers and tomatoes.
          Street sellers usually cook the curry on a flat griddle (tava) and
          serve the dish hot.

          pizza, dish of Italian origin consisting of a flattened disk of bread
          dough topped with some combination of olive oil, oregano, tomato,
          olives, mozzarella cheese, and many ingredients, baked
          quickly—usually, using a wood-fired oven
          heated to a very high temperature—and served hot.

        <p class="content">
          A grilled beef patty on a bun is called a burger. Lunch at a fast food
          restaurant often consists of a burger and fries. You can use the word
          burger as a casual shorthand for hamburger, which is ground or minced
          beef that's fried and served on a bun. A burger can also be made of
          other ingredients.
